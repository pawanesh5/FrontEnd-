This sprint has 6 demos

[**Demo 1 :: Create and Access Array Elements**](demo-1-create-and-access-array.js)

###### Problem Statement
Car showroom wants to list down makes of ​all the cars it has put on display​

[**Demo 3 :: Using Array Functions**](demo-3-non-premium-product-discount-and-stock.js)

###### Problem Statement

At Ricky's fashion store, you can't have discount over the premium products. Premium products are ones which costs more than 300 USD. A non-premium product can be sold at a discount of 15%.​

Let's say we have a region R where people have a tendency of shopping products which are sold at a discount. Items which are not at a discount are unlikely to be sold.  ​

Help the shopkeeper with a range of products which has the potential of being sold at his shop.​

- Filter out the premium products.​
- Apply a 15% discount on all the non-premium products.​
- Create a stock of each product type.​
